# Me, Myself and I

- Hi! I am Dheeraj Lalwani.
- This repository is about [*Me, Myself and I*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K533gW3boIY).<br>
- I work mainly work with backend, databases, networking and anything server-side. 
- Recently I've also started verturing into client-side development.
- I ~~call~~ (want to?) (consider?) myself a builder and someone who's interested in Product Development. 
- I love experimenting with very small things in products, be it an easter egg in some project or a subtle animation or even small but helpful additions in projects which reduce friction between the user and the product.
- I find inner peace when I am plugged in, EDM music blaring and I'm knees deep sunken into hacking a project or a solution to some problem I've been facing in real life.
- Sometimes, I struggle (attempt to?) write about my experiences, thoughts and feelings [here](https://dheerajdlalwani.github.io/somethings-just-like-this).
- You can take a look at some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/dheerajdlalwani).
- If you wish to know anything else about Me, Myself and I, feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/dheerajdlalwani/dheerajdlalwani.github.io/issues).
- There are multiple channels to get in touch with me. I love talking to people. 
- So please feel free to reach out to me, especially if you're working as a Backend Engineer, Networking, Databases, Server Side, Research or anything and anything in tech.
